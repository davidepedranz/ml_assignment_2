\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

For this classification problem, \ac{SVM} was the best choice, performing better then Naive Bayes and Random Forest.
Random Forest scored second, performing only slightly worse than \ac{SVM}.
Naive Bayes performed worst, with a significant difference from both the other two algorithms.
The performances of the three learning algorithms are summarized in \cref{tab:summary}.
