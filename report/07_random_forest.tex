\section{Random Forest}
\label{sec:random_forest}

Random Forest is an enseble learning method that combines multiple Decision Trees.
The aim is to reduce the variance of each tree and thus better generealize on new examples.
A specified number of Decision Trees are learned in a sequence and combined togheter.
The resulting prediction of the Random Forest is simply the average of the prediction of all trees.

The performances of Random Forest are reported in table \cref{tab:random_forest}.
It scored on average $0.948$ on each indicator, perfoming slightly worse then \ac{SVM} but much better than Naive Bayes.
