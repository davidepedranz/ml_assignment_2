\section{Learning problem}
\label{sec:learning_problem}

We focus on a binary classification problem.
The sample data are generated using the \texttt{make\_classification} function in the \texttt{scikit.datasets} package.
We generated a problem with \num{5000} examples, each of them with \num{15} features.
Only \num{10} of them actually influence the class, the others are either a linear combination of the other, repeated or just noise.
